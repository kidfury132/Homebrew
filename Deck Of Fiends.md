# Description

## Drawing From the Deck
When a creature draws a card (**1 Action**), [[Azgoth, The final Draw]] appears and kicks the creature that drew the card in the groin.

After the punishment, roll a **DC 9 flat d20** to determine whether the card returns to the deck.

- On a **success**, the card returns to the deck.
- On a **20**, roll again:
  - If the second roll is also a **20**, the card glows golden, returns to the deck, and grants a replenishment reward from the table below.

All replenishment powers granted by the deck are **temporary** and are lost if unused before the creature finishes a **Long Rest**.

After granting a reward, [[Azgoth, The final Draw]] produces a scroll and announces:

> *"Congratulations. You have been granted [Name of Power] benefits. Please abuse responsibly."*

---
## The Star Exception
If the drawn card is **The Star (Ace of Spades)**:

Azgoth first asks the creature to state their **greatest wish**, then immediately performs the punishment.

---
## Azgoth’s Conduct
- The same pit fiend appears each time the deck is used.
- Azgoth performs punishment as professional duty.
- He does not attack further unless provoked.

---

# Appearance

The deck is housed in a finely carved ivory case decorated with dragons, infernal runes, and arcane filigree traced in gold. Small horn accents decorate the housing. The interior is lined with deep crimson velvet.

The cards themselves are crafted from an unknown, non-paper material, smooth, cool, and unnaturally durable. Their gilded edges shimmer when stacked. All cards display raised gold sigils combining celestial distortion and infernal geometry.

---
# Aura

The deck radiates a distinctly fiendish aura, suggesting ties to dark bargains, forbidden rituals, and dangerous temptation.

---
# Cards

The deck contains:

- **51 Fool Cards**
- **1 Star Card**
- **The Ledger** (Cycle Completion only)

---
## The Fool

A flamboyantly dressed traveler strides toward a jagged abyss, unaware of the danger. Infernal silhouettes appear to encourage their fall. Runes trail behind them forming mocking laughter symbols.

**Effect:** Maniacal laughter and bright multicoloured flashes burst from the card.

---
## The Star (Ace of Spades)

A radiant many-pointed star glows in a crimson sky. Its light is warm yet subtly twisted with barbed shapes. Molten gold drips from it while faint watching faces shift inside the glow.

**Effect:** Distant celestial choir music accompanied by radiant golden light.

---
## The Ledger

An immense infernal ledger bound in iron clasps filled with molten gold script that constantly rewrites itself. Emerald chains bind the book as names, debts, and broken bargains flicker across its pages.

The card evokes the certainty that every act of greed has already been recorded.

**Effect:** The air smells of parchment and molten coin. Endless quills scratching in unison echo as emerald and gold light radiates outward.

# History

The deck originally contained numerous individual reward cards. Infernal restructuring consolidated the artifact into its current Fool/Star system.

[[Azgoth, The final Draw]] was assigned to enforce the punishment mechanic and has remained bound to the deck ever since. He holds neither pride nor resentment toward the assignment, though he occasionally finds the duty inconvenient.
