*Pit Fiend of Mammon’s Ledger | Emerald Arbiter of Avarice*
> *“The contract was signed the moment you reached for the card.”*
---
# Overview

Azgoth is a Pit Fiend in service to Mammon, Lord of Minauros, the Third Layer of the Nine Hells. He is responsible for enforcing punishment upon those who draw from the [[Deck Of Fiends]]. While this duty represents only one of his responsibilities, it is one of his most visible and personally complicated assignments.

Azgoth is a fallen angel who believes divine justice and infernal justice are two sides of the same cosmic principle. He views punishment not as cruelty but as the inevitable consequence of unchecked desire. Though bound by infernal law, fragments of his celestial past allow him to show rare sympathy toward certain mortals.

---
# Personality

Azgoth is methodical, composed, and intensely professional. He treats enforcement as both a ritual and administrative obligation. His speech is formal and contract-driven, though he occasionally displays dry humour or reluctant empathy.
## Underling Hierarchy

### Chosen Underlings
Souls personally claimed by Azgoth.

- Typically, mortals who committed one catastrophic act of greed
- Often treated with unexpected fairness
- May receive limited trust or responsibility
### Assigned Underlings
Souls assigned by infernal hierarchy.

- Viewed as a workforce
- Managed efficiently
- Minimal personal attachment

Azgoth maintains a particular fondness for a group of mortal gamblers who repeatedly used the [[Deck Of Fiends]] and treated him with camaraderie. After their deaths, they became his closest trusted servants in Minauros.

---
# Appearance

Azgoth wears elaborate infernal armour modelled after the [[Deck Of Fiends]].

The armour features:

- Fool and Star motifs
- Shifting contract sigils
- Infernal script resembling card backs

### Contract Stress Indicators
When Azgoth approaches violation of infernal law:

- Emerald veins spread across armor
- Glyphs glow and rearrange
- Contract chains briefly manifest

---
# Infernal Contract of Enforcement

Azgoth is magically bound under Mammon’s authority to enforce punishment upon any creature that draws from the [[Deck Of Fiends]].

---
## Enforcement Rules

### Core Obligation
Azgoth must punish any creature who draws from the deck.

- Punishment occurs **exactly once per draw**
- Multiple punishments for one draw are forbidden
- Punishment must occur before the drawer’s death unless legally delayed

---
### Delay Clause
Azgoth may delay enforcement under protected circumstances:

- Trap-based or malicious deck usage
- Coercion or forced drawing
- Vulnerable or accidental drawers

Delayed punishment must still eventually occur.

---
### Refusal Prohibition
Azgoth cannot permanently refuse enforcement. Doing so constitutes breach of contract.

---
### Sealing Penalty

Contract violators risk imprisonment inside emerald binding constructs within the **Vault of Avarice**.

Sealed fiends:

- Remain conscious
- Lose rank and autonomy
- Exist in suspended contractual imprisonment

Azgoth fears this fate deeply.

---
## Manifestation Protocol

Azgoth is compelled to appear near the drawer whenever the deck is used.

After enforcement:

- He may remain temporary
- Extended absence risks disciplinary review

Azgoth often imposes personal time limits to avoid administrative consequences.

---
## Performance Quota

Azgoth maintains infernal status through steady soul acquisition.

He gains authority through:

- Punishment of greed-corrupted mortals
- Soul acquisition linked to gambling and avarice
- Expansion of an underling workforce

Failure risks reassignment or disciplinary action.

---
# Infernal Power Source

Azgoth derives strength from **Gilded Regret**, emotional residue produced when mortals suffer consequences of greed.

This fuels:

- His authority within Minauros
- Maintenance of infernal armour
- Empowerment of underlings
- Political capital within Mammon’s hierarchy

---
# Relationship With The Deck Of Fiends

The deck originally contained 12 reward cards. Infernal restructuring condensed the artefact into its Fool/Star system.

Azgoth was later assigned enforcement duty and has remained bound to the deck ever since.

He neither resents nor reveres the assignment, though he occasionally finds it tedious.

Azgoth stopped counting deck activations after surpassing one thousand uses.

---
# Interaction With Mortals

Azgoth remembers repeated deck users and may develop familiarity with them.

He may:

- Clarify infernal law
- Delay punishment under contract protections
- Offer limited assistance after enforcement
- Form professional or personal relationships

Azgoth will not directly fight alongside mortals except in self-defence or contract enforcement.

---
# Jackpot Ceremony

When a replenishment reward is granted, Azgoth produces a ceremonial scroll and announces:

> "Congratulations. You have been granted [Name of Power] benefits. Please abuse responsibly."

All jackpot events are recorded in infernal administrative records.

---
# Contract Breach Indicators

If Azgoth risks violating infernal law:

- Emerald fractures form across armor
- Coin-chain sigils manifest
- His voice echoes with layered contract incantations
